# Polygon generator

*The algorithm starts with the random point, then creates the polygon by sampling points on a circles centered at the point. 
*Randon variance is added by random angles between sequential points and random radii from the centre to each point.
*Additional verifications are performed to ensure simple polygons and no collinearity between adjacent vertex.
*Under defualt setting, generation of 1k images takes 14 sec.
*Returns a list of vertices, in CCW order. In most cases, first point will be middle left one.

# Config:
img_num            # how many images to generate
distort            # whether to apply image distortion
numVerts           # number of polygon vertex
dir                # dir containing 'images" folder
collin_coef        # [0,1] how far angles shall be from 180Â°
aveRadius          # mean for sampling radii
angular_variance   # [0,1] the variance in angles
radii_variance     # [0,1] the variance in length
input_size         # image size will be (input_size,input_size)

# Requirements:
For image distortion latest ```imgaug``` is required:
```!pip install git+https://github.com/aleju/imgaug.git```

Also usual stuff: python-openCV, numpy, pandas
